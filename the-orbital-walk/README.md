# 🥾 The Orbital Walk

**Live site:** https://zetacodematrix.github.io/code-institute/the-orbital-walk/  

A simple, friendly walkthrough site built to practise **HTML, CSS, layout, navigation, and incremental GitHub deployment** using GitHub Pages as part of front-end web development learning.

## 🌍 About

**The Orbital Walk** is a seasonal, fictional community walking project focused on exploring the **London M25 Walking Circle** one café and pub stop at a time. The site introduces walkers to relaxed Sunday stages around the orbital path, connecting green corridors, rivers, historic villages, and urban edges across London.

Each stage includes:
- A planned Sunday walk between **8 and 14 miles**.
- Social stops like cafés and cosy pubs.
- A chance to explore nature, views, and company along the route.

## 🧭 Project Goals

The purpose of this project is to practise and demonstrate:

- Clean **HTML structure** and semantic markup
- Basic **CSS styling** and layout
- Use of **Bootstrap** for responsive components
- Navigation across multiple pages
- Deployment to GitHub Pages
- Incremental version history and commits
- Integrating simple imagery and assets
- Portfolio enrichment with a small static site

All code is handcrafted, and any AI-generated content or suggestions are **reviewed and edited manually** before inclusion.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Bootstrap (CSS framework)**
- **Git & GitHub**

## 🧩 How It Works

This is a **static site** with separate pages for different sections, such as:

- **Home:** Overview of The Orbital Walk and upcoming featured stage.  
- **Walks & Route:** Details of stages and walking information. 
- **Join a Walk:** Call-to-action buttons for walking stages. 
- **Our Story:** Background and rationale for the community project.

Navigation between pages is handled with a simple navbar component. Images and content have been added to create a welcoming, informative experience.
