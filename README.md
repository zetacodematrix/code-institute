# Code Institute Projects

This repository acts as a central hub for my Code Institute coursework and milestone projects.  
Each project demonstrates core web development skills including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, UX design, and responsive layout techniques.

## Live Projects

- **[Love Running](https://zetacodematrix.github.io/love-running/)**  
  A responsive running club website focusing on accessibility, clear structure, and mobile-first design.

- **[Portfolio Site](https://zetacodematrix.github.io/code-institute/portfolio/)**  
  A clean, professional developer portfolio inspired by modern Bootstrap layouts.

## Future Work

More projects will be added here as I progress through the course, including JavaScript apps, interactive features, and full-stack builds.
