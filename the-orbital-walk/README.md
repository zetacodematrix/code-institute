# The Orbital Walk

This project is a simple seasonal walkthrough site built as part of ongoing web-development learning.

Live page:
https://zetacodematrix.github.io/code-institute/the-orbital-walk/

Each season has its own HTML page and light styling. The focus is on practising layout, navigation, HTML structure, and incremental GitHub deployment using GitHub Pages.


## How it works

- Plain HTML and CSS (including a custom stylesheet)
- Bootstrap is used for layout support
- Static assets are served via GitHub Pages
- Files are deployed incrementally using standard Git workflow


## Learning approach

This project is being built step by step in public while revisiting foundational front-end skills. The aim is to practise clean commits, build confidence with GitHub Pages, and expand a portfolio of small web pieces over time.


## Use of Generative AI

Generative AI tools have been used to help structure ideas, prompt design suggestions, and co-produce text and HTML. All code is manually reviewed and edited during development.


## Status

Work in progress. More pages and improvements will be added gradually.
